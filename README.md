Idea: Platformer Game that revolves around collecting weapons/items and using boss fights to create even better items

# Concept Paper
--------------------

-Procedural Generation of levels to allow extreme replayabillity

-Boss is summoned with the boss shrine at the end of a level, along with the player's items place into it

-"Boss Crafting": depending on items placed into summoning chamber, the boss will spawn with deifferent abillities and extra stats 

-Better items/more items of type placed, higher chance of type of item/quality (loot based gameplay loop)

-Instill sense of urgency: Done with weapons degrading over time?

-Endless inventory?

-VISIBLE PLAYER, but still recognizable in a swarm

-Demonic/Satanic ritual themes

-"Glorify" an item for another playthrough

-Co-op for online play and couch co-op styles
