Extra Lore-

_____ - Moon god

Not real, but a part of the mythology

Main Plot – Corporations and Governments control mining of special minerals, “Substances”

They have funded groups that go underground and search for minerals

Very shady and not much is known about these groups, but people know they make a lot of money

Other smaller groups try to emulate these results through improper information

Most of these groups never come back, but the knowledge of the money and power draw more people to do it off of hearsay 

Character introduction – Drawn by small mining outfit to be a “Guard”, they are paying you a lot!

Greed drives the expedition and the unexperienced miners don’t really know what they are doing

They go much deeper than they normally do, but they fail to mine correctly and trap the player in a mineshaft

The player has to continue downward since the player cannot leave the way they came

Level Design/environments/enemies – Levels change, but feel is similar to each tier and section, such as the random elements such as placement of enemies, platforms, maze structures

First section is an introduction set of levels- based around platforming, enemy’s movements, and certain elements (ladders, ropes, lava pits, swinging things/stabby bits)

Then first hub world area, you can choose your missions that are randomly generated but have set goals designed by the mission. 

---BONUS SHIT---
Bosses are at the end of these missions and require you to kill the boss so you can use the demon portal and go back to the hub world and go to the next mission/path. 

Three sections – First section = easy enemies and weak demons, low technology, hub world has less crazy weapon tech and good mining tools for movement and safety. Hub world is inhabited by miners mostly 

Second section = Less earth style creatures, more demons that are stronger, hub world has a mix of good armor and some weapons. Hub world is inhabited by corporations and mining companies that are very powerful, scientists and what not as well. 

Third Section = only powerful demons, hub world is the bees knees of all good weapons. Hub world is inhabited by a Coalition of Governments (LAWL) that supplies, for a high price, crazy weapons and technologies only found there.  “A LOT OF FUCKING WORK TO MAKE ONE HUB WORLD” – Marcus Wehof 2016, literally worse than Hitler
